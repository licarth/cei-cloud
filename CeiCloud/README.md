INTRODUCTION
------------

CeiCloud is a Sup√©lec IT department project. Designed for experiments detailed in paper release [Bin packing algorithms applied to load balancing in a cloud environment](link!), this project is a framework to describe problems, implement several algorithms to solve these problems and compare their relative precision (or absolute if solutions are built in such a way that we know their optimal cost).

TODO
----

Enhance benchmarking classes (benckmark package).
