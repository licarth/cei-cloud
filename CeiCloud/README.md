Introduction
------------

CeiCloud is a Sup√©lec IT department project. Designed for experiments detailed in paper release [Bin packing algorithms applied to load balancing in a cloud environment](link!), this project is a framework to describe problems, implement several algorithms to solve these problems and compare their relative precision.

This framework covers :
*	Problem definitions
*	Instance definitions
*	Generation of instances of those problems
*	Algorithms definitions (for a certain problem)
*	Benchmarks to compare algorithms

This formalism has been defined in order to be used in paper realease mentioned above.

Build
-----

This project relies on Maven dependency management. The easiest way to import dependencies and build is to use Maven.


Todo
----

Enhance benchmarking classes (benckmark package).
